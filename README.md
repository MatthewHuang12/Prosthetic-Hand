# My Hand Gripper Project

This is my Arduino-based hand gripper that I built for my BME 261 class. It's a prosthetic hand controller that can be operated in two different ways.

## What it does

The gripper can open and close like a hand, and you can control it by:

- Pressing a button to toggle it open/closed
- Using an EMG sensor that detects muscle signals
